EconoVation is a dedicated team of local students supported by a Central Asian Student Association at the University of California, Berkeley, a leading US university (top 10 globally) and KPMG Uzbekistan, one of big 4 companies around the world. We use financial education and consulting to elevate people from socially vulnerable backgrounds, and provide them with experience and job. Helping local businesses with marketing advice and redesigns, we tackle gender issues and labor migration in Uzbekistan.
