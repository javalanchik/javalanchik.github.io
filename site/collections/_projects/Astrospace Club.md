Astrospace Club – Founded in 2023 at Jizzakh Presidential School, the top school in Uzbekistan, Astrospace is all about inspiring students to learn more about space and astronomy. Since we started, we've accomplished some amazing things. We built a rocket that could really fly, hosted fun space-themed activities like stargazing nights, and even created a basic version of solar panels. Our hard work paid off when we won funding from an organization, which helped us buy a telescope. We’ve already used it to get a close-up view of the half-moon. Astrospace isn’t just about learning; it’s about hands-on experiences. We give students the chance to explore the wonders of space, work on cool projects, and connect with others who share the same passion. Whether you're curious about building rockets, observing the night sky, or experimenting with new ideas, there's a place for you in the Astrospace Club.
