“Help someone today, and tomorrow help will come to you.”

Our organization was created for sympathetic and good-natured people.

The main goal of «Noble heart» is to inspire the new generation to perform acts of kindness. We organize various charity events and trips to support low-income families, orphanages, hospices, and shelters.

On the top of that, we hold large-scale events open to everyone, where our volunteers can showcase their skills and take part in organizing. All funds raised at these events are also directed toward charity.

Founded in 2022, the project has been actively running for two years.
